# Code-along Dice
From a code-along session, each student started from the same base. The purpose of the assignment was to further
develop upon the given code, freely adding features. After some time each student presented their additions to the
game.

I added the following:
* Score
* Round limit
* Round counter
* Pretty printing each played round and the outcome
* A winner screen (alt. draw screen if both participants tied)
